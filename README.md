Classification with Python
Below, is where I am going to use the classification algorithms to create a model based on our training data and evaluate our testing data using evaluation metrics.

I will use some of the algorithms, specifically:

Linear Regression
KNN
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
SVM

I will evaluate our models using:

Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
LogLoss
Mean Absolute Error
Mean Squared Error
R2-Score
Finally, I will use your models to generate the report at the end.
